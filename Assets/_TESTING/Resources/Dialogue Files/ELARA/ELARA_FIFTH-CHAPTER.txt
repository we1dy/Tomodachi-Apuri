narrator "You glance at her, her fingers are gripping her arms, knuckles white. Her breathing is shallow, and her eyes are fixed on the storm, {wa 0.75}as if she’s trying to will it away. You nudge her gently, your voice light to mask your concern."

narrator "There it is again—{wa 0.75}that faint vulnerability in her voice, catching you off guard.

It fills you with a quiet warmth, knowing she trusts you enough to let you see her as she truly is."
